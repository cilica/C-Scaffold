## Google Test
- Right now Google test libraries are pre-build (not nice - alterative would have been to download them in the project but I don't find the need for it). So. use only for x64 Windows systems. For others, the libs in gtest must be replaced by libs buid for your specific system.
- To build own libraries go to https://github.com/google/googletest
